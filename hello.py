# comments in python is made by starting a line using #

# you can change from int to float using the float(), int(), complex() function 
#example

x= 1
y = 2.89
j = 1j
#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
